📝 The project was done in the CodePen environment, so I **transfered it to GitHub** and **made some improvements**:

* Better **commenting** and **code readability**.
* Created **favicon**.
* Recreated header bottom image for **high resolution screens**.
* Deleted repetitive or unnecessary CCS code lines and so **simplified the code**.
* Adjusted margins, paddings and font sizes for **tablet and mobile layouts**.
